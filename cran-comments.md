This is a resubmission of the gender package after making requested corrections
and rerunning checks.

-   Examples run in the "few seconds" required by the policies.
-   There are notes about "no visible binding for global variables" but
    these are spurious. I have double checked each of these by name, and all
    of these variables are not global, but are columns within the dataframes 
    used by the package as manipulated by dplyr.
-   Requested corrections to DESCRIPTION file have been made.
-   Data that exceeded the 5MB limit has been removed.
