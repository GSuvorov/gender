This is a resubmission of the gender package after making requested corrections
and rerunning checks.

-   There are notes about "no visible binding for global variables" but
    these are spurious. These variables are not global, but are within the
    data used by the package as manipulated by dplyr.
-   Requested corrections to DESCRIPTION file have been made.
-   Data that exceeded the 5MB limit has been removed.
