This is a resubmission of the gender package after making requested
corrections and rerunning checks. Below is the list of changes made
since first submission:

-   All examples have been marked do not run. On my machine I see tests
    that take 11 seconds and vignettes that take 11 seconds, which is
    less than one-third of 100 seconds.
-   The check no longer complains about global variables.
-   Format of the LICENSE file has been changed as requested.
-   Examples run in the "few seconds" required by the policies.
-   Requested corrections to DESCRIPTION file have been made.
-   Data that exceeded the 5MB limit has been removed.
