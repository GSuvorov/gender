This is a resubmission of the gender package after making requested corrections
and rerunning checks. Below is the list of changes made since first 
submission:

-   Run time of examples, vignettes, and tests have been minimized. Allowing 
    for the differences between machines, I believe this meets the request to
    reduce timings by a factor of 3x.
-   The check no longer complains about global variables.
-   Format of the LICENSE file has been changed as requested.
-   Examples run in the "few seconds" required by the policies.
-   Requested corrections to DESCRIPTION file have been made.
-   Data that exceeded the 5MB limit has been removed.
