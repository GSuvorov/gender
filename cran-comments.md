This is a resubmission of the gender package after making requested
corrections and rerunning checks. My apologies to the CRAN maintainers
for my error in submitting the package earlier, and thanks for their
patience. Below is the list of changes made since first submission:

-   The package includes a minimal "demo" dataset, which is used for
    tests and vignettes. Users will be prompted to install the full
    datasets from GitHub as necessary.
-   Tests and vignettes have been streamlined to execute faster.
-   The check no longer complains about global variables.
-   Format of the LICENSE file has been changed as requested.
-   Examples run in the "few seconds" required by the policies.
-   Requested corrections to DESCRIPTION file have been made.
-   Data that exceeded the 5MB limit has been removed and put into a
    separate data package which will not be on CRAN.
