A common problem for historians working with data is that they have names but not gender.

```{r}
library(gender)
gender("madison")
```

By using the `certainty` option you can determine whether or not to return the proportion of male and female names. When predicting gender the `gender()` function assumes that any proportion above `0.5` should be male or female. If you want to be more certain about your prediction, you can use the certainty columns to make the prediction yourself.
