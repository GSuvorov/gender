Description: Encodes gender based on names and dates of birth, using either the
    Social Security Administration's data set of first names by year of birth
    or the U.S. Census data from 1789 to 1940. By using these data sets instead
    of lists of male and female names, this package is able to more accurately
    guess the gender of a name, and it is able to report the probability that a
    name was male or female. Includes contributions by Cameron Blevins and
    Benjamin Schmidt.
