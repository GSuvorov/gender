Description: Encodes gender based on names and dates of birth, using the Social
    Security Administration's data set of first names by year and state. By
    using the SSA data instead of lists of male and female names, this package
    is able to more accurately guess the gender of a name, and it is able to
    report the probability that a name was male or female. Based on an
    algorithm devised by Cameron Blevins.
