Title: Predict Gender from Names Using Historical Data
Version: 0.5.0.9000
Date: 2015-08-18
Authors@R: c(person("Lincoln", "Mullen", role = c("aut", "cre"),
    email = "lincoln@lincolnmullen.com"),
    person("Cameron", "Blevins", role = "ctb"),
    person("Ben", "Schmidt", role = "ctb"))
Description: Encodes gender based on names and dates of birth, using either the
    Social Security Administration's data set of first names by year of birth
    or the Census Bureau data from 1789 to 1940, both from the United States of
    America. By using these data sets instead of lists of male and female names,
    this package is able to more accurately guess the gender of a name, and it
    is able to report the probability that a name was male or female.
